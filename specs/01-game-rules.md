# Module 01: Game Rules

## Requirements

### 1.1 Domain Type Vocabulary

**01-REQ-001**: The system shall define a `Direction` type with exactly four values: `Up`, `Right`, `Down`, `Left`.

**01-REQ-002**: The system shall define a `CellType` with values: `Normal`, `Wall`, `Hazard`, `Fertile`.

**01-REQ-003**: The system shall define four named board sizes with the following properties:

| Label  | Total Grid | Playable Area |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Small  | 11×11     | 9×9 (81 cells)  |
| Medium | 13×13     | 11×11 (121 cells) |
| Large  | 17×17     | 15×15 (225 cells) |
| Giant  | 21×21     | 19×19 (361 cells) |

**01-REQ-004**: The system shall define a `SnakeState` type with the following fields:
- `snakeId`: unique identifier
- `letter`: single alphabetic character assigned at game start
- `centaurTeamId`: owning CentaurTeam
- `body`: ordered list of cell positions, head first, tail last; length = number of segments
- `health`: integer
- `activeEffects`: collection of active potion effects, each with shape `{ family, state, expiryTurn }` where `family ∈ {invulnerability, invisibility}` and `state ∈ {buff, debuff}`. A snake holds at most one active effect per family (see 01-REQ-028).
- `pendingEffects`: collection of pending potion effects with the same shape as `activeEffects`, scheduled for application in Phase 9 of the collecting turn and becoming observable from the next turn onward. At most one pending effect per family per snake at any point (see 01-REQ-047).
- `lastDirection`: nullable Direction
- `alive`: boolean
- `ateLastTurn`: boolean

`invulnerabilityLevel` and `visible` are *not* fields of `SnakeState`. They are derived from `activeEffects` per 01-REQ-022 and 01-REQ-023 respectively and computed on demand; the design section specifies the functions.

**01-REQ-005**: The system shall define an `ItemType` with values: `Food`, `InvulnPotion`, `InvisPotion`.

**01-REQ-006**: The system shall define a potion `EffectFamily` with values `invulnerability` and `invisibility`, and an `EffectState` with values `buff` and `debuff`. A potion effect is a `(family, state, expiryTurn)` triple. The four combinations are the exhaustive set of potion effects a snake can hold.

**01-REQ-007**: The system shall define an `ItemState` tracking each item's type, cell position, and whether it has been consumed.

---

### 1.2 Board Construction

**01-REQ-008**: The board shall be a rectangular grid of the configured size. All cells on the outermost 1-cell-thick border shall be `Wall` type. All remaining cells are inner cells.

**01-REQ-009**: The playable area for each board size is the inner cells as defined in 01-REQ-003 (total grid minus the 1-cell wall border on each side).

**01-REQ-010**: If the configured hazard percentage H > 0, `floor(inner_cell_count × H / 100)` inner cells shall be designated `Hazard`, chosen using randomness seeded from the game seed. Hazard placement shall guarantee that all non-Hazard, non-Wall inner cells form a single connected region.

**01-REQ-011**: Hazard cells are permanent terrain for the duration of the game. Items may occupy a Hazard cell simultaneously with hazard terrain.

**01-REQ-012**: If fertile ground is enabled, a subset of inner non-Wall non-Hazard cells shall be designated `Fertile` at game start. Fertile designations shall not change during the game.

**01-REQ-013**: Fertile tile selection shall use 4-octave fractal Perlin noise seeded from the game seed. Each successive octave doubles the base frequency of the previous and halves its amplitude. The clustering parameter C (integer 1–20) controls the base frequency of the first octave: low C → high base frequency → small scattered patches; high C → low base frequency → large contiguous blobs. The density parameter D (integer percent 1–90) controls coverage: the top D% of candidate inner non-Wall non-Hazard cells ranked by their noise score are designated Fertile.

**01-REQ-014**: For an N-team game, the board shall be divided into N starting territories by overlaying a circular pie centred on the board with N equal angular sectors. The angular offset of the pie shall be chosen randomly using the game seed. Each inner cell shall be assigned to the sector it overlaps most with; ties broken randomly using the game seed.

**01-REQ-015**: Each snake's starting head position shall be placed on a randomly chosen non-Wall, non-Hazard inner cell within its team's starting territory, using randomness seeded from the game seed.

**01-REQ-016**: All snake head starting positions across all teams shall be placed on cells of the same parity, where parity is `(x + y) mod 2`. The parity value (0 or 1) shall be chosen randomly using the game seed.

**01-REQ-017**: After all snake starting positions are assigned, one food item per snake shall be spawned on an eligible cell chosen randomly using the game seed. An eligible cell is inner, non-Wall, non-Hazard, and not occupied by a snake body. If fertile ground is enabled, eligible cells are additionally restricted to Fertile cells.

**01-REQ-061 (Board generation feasibility and bounded retry)**: Board generation (the full sequence of hazard placement, fertile tile selection, territory assignment, parity choice, starting-position assignment, and initial food placement, per 01-REQ-010 through 01-REQ-017) shall be treated as a single attempt that either succeeds or fails. An attempt **fails** if any of the following conditions holds:
- Hazard placement cannot satisfy the single-connected-region constraint of 01-REQ-010.
- For the chosen parity (01-REQ-016), at least one team's territory does not contain `snakesPerTeam` distinct non-Wall, non-Hazard inner cells of that parity for starting-head placement per 01-REQ-015.
- After starting-position assignment, the set of cells eligible for initial food placement under 01-REQ-017 (inner, non-Wall, non-Hazard, not occupied by a snake body; additionally Fertile if fertile ground is enabled) contains fewer than `totalSnakeCount` distinct cells, so that 01-REQ-017's one-food-per-snake mandate cannot be satisfied.

If an attempt fails, the setup process shall retry using a deterministic sub-seed derived from the game seed and an attempt counter, re-running the full generation sequence. Up to **three retries** shall be performed (four attempts total). If all four attempts fail, board generation shall be reported as **infeasible** for the current game configuration: the game shall be left in an unplayable state accompanied by a machine-readable error identifying which constraint failed on the final attempt, and the room owner shall be able to modify the game configuration and re-attempt provisioning.

The mechanism for deriving per-attempt sub-seeds from the game seed is a design-phase concern; the requirement here is only that each attempt uses a distinct deterministic seed derivable from the game seed plus the attempt index, so that the sequence of attempts (and the ultimate success or failure) is reproducible from the game seed alone.

---

### 1.3 Snake Initialization

**01-REQ-018**: Each snake shall be assigned a unique letter designation within its team, assigned consecutively starting from `A`. A snake's display name is `{centaurTeamName}.{letter}` (e.g., `Red.A`).

**01-REQ-019**: The number of snakes each team fields per game shall be equal across all teams and is determined by the configured `snakesPerTeam` parameter (1–10).

**01-REQ-020**: At game start, every snake shall have length 3 with all three body segments positioned on the snake's starting cell.

**01-REQ-021**: At game start, every snake shall have `health = MaxHealth`, `activeEffects = []`, `pendingEffects = []`, `ateLastTurn = false`, `lastDirection = null`, `alive = true`. Because `activeEffects` is empty, the derived `invulnerabilityLevel` is `0` and the derived `visible` is `true` for every snake at game start.

---

### 1.4 Items and Derived Effect Fields

**01-REQ-022**: A snake's `invulnerabilityLevel` is a derived value in `{-1, 0, +1}` computed from its `activeEffects`:
- `+1` if the snake holds an active effect with `family = invulnerability` and `state = buff`
- `-1` if the snake holds an active effect with `family = invulnerability` and `state = debuff`
- `0` otherwise (no active invulnerability effect)

Because a snake holds at most one active effect per family (01-REQ-028), these cases are exhaustive and mutually exclusive. `invulnerabilityLevel` is used exclusively for collision outcome resolution in 01-REQ-044c and 01-REQ-044d; it is not a stored field.

**01-REQ-023**: A snake's `visible` value is derived: `visible = false` if and only if the snake holds an active effect with `family = invisibility` and `state = buff`; otherwise `visible = true`. A snake holding an active `(invisibility, debuff)` effect — the invisibility collector — **remains visible**, so that opponents can target them for disruption. `visible` is not a stored field.

**01-REQ-024**: Invisible snakes (visible = false) shall not be observable by connections belonging to opponent teams. All game mechanics (collision, severing, health, scoring) apply to invisible snakes identically to visible snakes. Invisibility is an information asymmetry only.

**01-REQ-025**: When a surviving snake's head occupies a food cell during turn resolution, the food item is consumed: `ateLastTurn` is set to `true` and `health` is restored to `MaxHealth`. Item collection (food or potions) is *not* a disruption — see 01-REQ-030.

**01-REQ-026**: When one or more surviving snakes belonging to a team T collect one or more InvulnPotions during Phase 6 of the same turn, a single team rebuild of the `invulnerability` family is scheduled via `pendingEffects`: every alive member of T receives one pending effect `(family = invulnerability, state, expiryTurn = currentTurn + 3)` where `state = debuff` if the member collected a potion this turn and `state = buff` otherwise. This rebuild *replaces* any existing active or pending invulnerability-family effect on every member of T in Phase 9 (see 01-REQ-047 and 01-REQ-050).

**01-REQ-027**: When one or more surviving snakes belonging to a team T collect one or more InvisPotions during Phase 6 of the same turn, a single team rebuild of the `invisibility` family is scheduled via `pendingEffects` analogously to 01-REQ-026: every alive member of T receives one pending `(family = invisibility, state, expiryTurn = currentTurn + 3)`, where `state = debuff` for snakes that collected this turn and `state = buff` otherwise. An invisibility-family `debuff` holder remains visible per 01-REQ-023. This rebuild replaces any existing active or pending invisibility-family effect on every member of T in Phase 9.

---

### 1.5 Disruptions and Potion Effect Cancellation

**01-REQ-028**: A snake holds at most one active effect per family and at most one pending effect per family. This is a structural invariant maintained by Phase 6's team rebuild semantics (01-REQ-047) and Phase 9's replace-semantics effect application (01-REQ-050); no phase inserts an effect of a family already present without first removing the prior one. A snake is the **active collector for family F** if and only if it currently holds an active effect `(family = F, state = debuff)`. A snake may simultaneously be the active collector for both families (one debuff of each); the two families are independent.

**01-REQ-029**: *(Retired. ID not reused. See resolved 01-REVIEW-015.)*

**01-REQ-030**: A **disruption** is any of the following events experienced by a snake during turn resolution. This set is closed:
- (a) Death from any cause
- (b) Severing another snake's body
- (c) Being severed by another snake
- (d) Receiving a body collision — a foreign snake's head enters a cell occupied by this snake's body
- (e) Entering a hazard cell

Item collection (food, InvulnPotion, InvisPotion) is explicitly *not* a disruption.

**01-REQ-031**: If a snake that is the active collector for family F (01-REQ-028) suffers any disruption during turn resolution, a team-wide, family-scoped cancellation shall be scheduled for Phase 9: every active effect of family F shall be removed from every alive member of the collector's team. Other families are untouched. If the disrupted snake is the active collector for both families simultaneously, both families cancel independently. Cancellation removes active effects only; pending effects scheduled by a Phase 6 rebuild in the same turn (01-REQ-047) are not discarded and proceed to application in Phase 9 step (b) normally. A same-turn re-collection therefore supersedes a disruption-triggered cancellation of the same family.

**01-REQ-032**: *(Retired. ID not reused. See resolved 01-REVIEW-015.)*

---

### 1.6 Effect Immutability

**01-REQ-033**: All reads of `activeEffects` (and the values derived from it — `invulnerabilityLevel` per 01-REQ-022 and `visible` per 01-REQ-023) during collision detection and disruption evaluation within a turn shall return each snake's start-of-turn values. Any effect gained, cancelled, or expired during the current turn's resolution shall have no observable influence on that turn's collision or disruption outcomes; such changes become observable no earlier than Phase 9 and are reflected in subsequent turns' start-of-turn values. See resolved 01-REVIEW-014.

---

### 1.7 Chess Timer

**01-REQ-034**: Each team shall have a **time budget** (non-negative integer, milliseconds) that persists across turns within a game.

**01-REQ-035**: The time budget for each team at game start shall be the configured `initialBudget`.

**01-REQ-036**: At the start of each turn, each team's budget shall be incremented by the configured `budgetIncrement` (default 500ms).

**01-REQ-037**: At the start of each turn, each team's **per-turn clock** shall be set to `min(effectiveCap, currentBudget)`. The effective cap is `firstTurnTime` (default 60s) on turn 0 and `maxTurnTime` (default 10s) on all subsequent turns.

**01-REQ-038**: A team may **declare turn over** at any time during the current turn. Upon declaration, the team's remaining per-turn clock time is added back to its budget. The team's per-turn clock stops.

**01-REQ-039**: A team's turn shall be automatically declared over when its per-turn clock reaches zero.

**01-REQ-040**: Turn resolution shall commence when all teams have declared turn over (whether explicitly or by clock expiry).

---

### 1.8 Turn Resolution Pipeline

**01-REQ-041**: Turn resolution shall execute the following eleven phases in strict order once per turn:

1. Move Collection
2. Snake Movement
3. Collision Detection
4. Pending Effect Recording
5. Health, Hazards, and Food
6. Potion Collection
7. Food Spawning
8. Potion Spawning
9. Effect Application and Expiry
10. Win Condition Check
11. Event Emission

**01-REQ-042 (Phase 1 — Move Collection)**: For each alive snake, its direction for this turn shall be determined as follows: (a) if a move is staged, use that direction; (b) else if `lastDirection` is non-null, use `lastDirection` unconditionally (even if that cell is lethal); (c) else (no prior direction, only possible on turn 0 with no move staged) choose a direction uniformly at random from {Up, Right, Down, Left} using the turn seed (01-REQ-060). The random choice is not constrained to non-lethal cells — if the chosen direction would cause wall or self-collision, the snake dies in Phase 3 as it would from any other fatal move. See resolved 01-REVIEW-006.

**01-REQ-043 (Phase 2 — Snake Movement)**: All alive snakes shall move simultaneously. Each snake's head advances one cell in its chosen direction. If `ateLastTurn` is `true`, the tail segment is retained and `ateLastTurn` is reset to `false`; otherwise the tail segment is removed. `lastDirection` is updated to the direction moved.

**01-REQ-044 (Phase 3 — Collision Detection)**: After all snakes have moved in Phase 2, the following collision types shall be evaluated simultaneously, reading each snake's start-of-turn effect state per 01-REQ-033. "Simultaneously" means no sub-ordering within Phase 3: the post-Phase-2 board configuration (all moved heads and all body segments of all snakes, including snakes that are themselves dying from wall or self-collision within this same Phase 3) is the single reference state against which every collision rule is evaluated. A snake dying from wall or self-collision in Phase 3 does not have its body removed from Phase 3's evaluation; its segments remain valid body-collision targets for other snakes in the same pass. See resolved 01-REVIEW-002 for a worked example.

**01-REQ-044a (Wall collision)**: A snake whose head occupies a Wall cell after Phase 2 dies.

**01-REQ-044b (Self-collision)**: A snake whose head occupies a cell containing any other segment of its own body after Phase 2 dies. (The just-vacated tail cell is not included, as the tail is removed in Phase 2 before this check.)

**01-REQ-044c (Body collision)**: A snake (attacker) whose head occupies a cell containing a non-head body segment of another snake (victim) after Phase 2 shall be resolved using each snake's start-of-turn `invulnerabilityLevel` (per 01-REQ-033): if the attacker's start-of-turn level exceeds the victim's start-of-turn level, the victim is **severed** — all body segments from the contact segment through the tail are removed from the victim, and the attacker survives; otherwise the attacker dies.

**01-REQ-044d (Head-to-head collision)**: When two or more snake heads occupy the same cell after Phase 2, resolution uses each involved snake's start-of-turn `invulnerabilityLevel` (per 01-REQ-033): snakes whose start-of-turn level is below the maximum start-of-turn level among the involved snakes die; among the remaining snakes (those at the maximum start-of-turn level), shorter snakes (fewer body segments after Phase 2) die; if two or more snakes at the maximum level have equal length, all of them die.

**01-REQ-045 (Phase 4 — Pending Effect Recording)**: For each snake that suffers any disruption in Phase 3 (death, severing, being severed, receiving a body collision) and is the active collector for at least one family per 01-REQ-028, the team-wide, family-scoped cancellation specified in 01-REQ-031 shall be scheduled for application in Phase 9, based on Phase 3 outcomes read against each snake's start-of-turn effect state (per 01-REQ-033). Cancellation scope is determined by which families the disrupted snake holds a `debuff` of at start-of-turn.

**01-REQ-046 (Phase 5 — Health, Hazards, and Food)**: The following are applied to each surviving snake in order. All health modifications shall be calculated before any starvation deaths are evaluated.

**01-REQ-046a (Health tick)**: 1 health point is subtracted from every surviving snake unconditionally.

**01-REQ-046b (Hazard damage)**: If a surviving snake's head occupies a Hazard cell, the configured `hazardDamage` (default 15) is subtracted from its health. Entering a hazard cell is a disruption; if the snake is an active potion collector, schedule cancellation per 01-REQ-031.

**01-REQ-046c (Food consumption)**: If a surviving snake's head occupies a food cell, the food is consumed: `ateLastTurn` is set to `true` and `health` is restored to `MaxHealth`. If the cell is simultaneously a Hazard cell, hazard damage from 01-REQ-046b is applied first (a disruption in its own right), then food healing (net health after tick, hazard, and food: `MaxHealth`). Eating food is *not* a disruption; the hazard entry on the same cell still is.

**01-REQ-046d (Starvation death)**: After all health modifications in Phase 5 are applied, any snake with health ≤ 0 dies of starvation. Starvation death is a disruption (subcase of "death from any cause" in 01-REQ-030). If the dead snake is an active potion collector, schedule cancellation per 01-REQ-031.

**01-REQ-047 (Phase 6 — Potion Collection)**: For each surviving snake whose head occupies a potion cell after Phase 2 movement, the potion is consumed. Phase 6 then aggregates by team and by potion family: for each team T and each family F such that at least one member of T consumed a potion of family F this turn, schedule the single team rebuild specified in 01-REQ-026 (for invulnerability) or 01-REQ-027 (for invisibility). The rebuild is recorded as per-member `pendingEffects` entries with a "replace on apply" marker at the family level, meaning Phase 9 (01-REQ-050) will remove any prior active or pending entry of the same family on each affected member before inserting the new one. Simultaneous multi-collection by the same team of the same family is collapsed into a single coherent rebuild: every collector-of-this-turn gets `state = debuff`, every non-collector alive teammate gets `state = buff`, and all affected members receive the same `expiryTurn = currentTurn + 3`. Potion collection is not a disruption (01-REQ-030).

**01-REQ-048 (Phase 7 — Food Spawning)**: Food shall spawn each turn. The expected count is the configured `foodSpawnRate` (a non-negative decimal; 0 means no food ever spawns). The guaranteed count is `floor(foodSpawnRate)` items, with probability `foodSpawnRate mod 1` of one additional item. Spawn locations are chosen randomly using the turn seed from eligible cells: inner, non-Wall, non-Hazard, and not currently occupied by a snake, food, or potion. When `fertileGroundEnabled(board)` is true (Section 3.2), eligible cells are further restricted to Fertile cells.

**01-REQ-049 (Phase 8 — Potion Spawning)**: InvulnPotions shall spawn each turn using `invulnPotionSpawnRate` by the same probabilistic mechanism and eligible-cell criteria as food; a spawn rate of 0 results in no invulnerability potions spawning. InvisPotions shall spawn independently each turn using `invisPotionSpawnRate` by the same mechanism; a spawn rate of 0 results in no invisibility potions spawning.

**01-REQ-050 (Phase 9 — Effect Application and Expiry)**: All pending effect cancellations and new effect additions scheduled during Phases 4–6 shall be applied in the following order: (a) cancellations scheduled under 01-REQ-031 remove all active effects of the cancelled families on every alive team member; (b) pending team rebuilds scheduled under 01-REQ-047 are applied with replace-semantics — for each affected `(snake, family)` pair, any remaining active effect of that family on that snake is removed and the rebuild's pending entry becomes active; (c) all active effects whose expiry condition has been reached (`currentTurn >= expiryTurn`) are removed. The per-family single-effect invariant of 01-REQ-028 holds at the end of Phase 9. `invulnerabilityLevel` and `visible` are derived values per 01-REQ-022/023 and require no separate recomputation step.

**01-REQ-051 (Phase 10 — Win Condition Check)**: Win conditions shall be evaluated as specified in Section 1.9 after Phase 9 effect application.

**01-REQ-052 (Phase 11 — Event Emission)**: Events shall be emitted for all significant outcomes of the current turn. The emitted event types are a closed set covering: snake movements (direction, growth, identity of who staged the move), deaths (cause, location), severing events, food consumption, potion collection (collector and affected teammates), food spawning, potion spawning, effect applications, and effect cancellations.

**01-REQ-062 (Growth from food consumption)**: If a snake consumes food during turn T (via 01-REQ-025 or 01-REQ-046c) and is still alive at the start of turn T+1, the snake's body length (segment count) at the end of turn T+1's Phase 2 shall be exactly one greater than its body length at the end of turn T's Phase 2. A snake that dies before completing Phase 2 of turn T+1 does not grow. See resolved 01-REVIEW-008.

---

### 1.9 Win Conditions and Scoring

**01-REQ-053**: A team's **score** at any game-end moment is the sum of the body lengths (number of segments) of all alive snakes belonging to that team at that moment.

**01-REQ-054 (Last team standing)**: The game ends when all snakes of every team except one are dead. The surviving team wins. Scores are computed from alive snake lengths at that turn.

**01-REQ-055 (Simultaneous elimination)**: If all remaining alive snakes across all teams die in the same turn, the game ends. Each team's score is their combined alive snake lengths from the immediately preceding turn. The team with the highest score wins; if two or more teams tie, the result is a draw.

**01-REQ-056**: For the simultaneous elimination case where the game ends on turn 0 (all snakes die on the first turn), scores shall be computed from the initial snake lengths at game start.

**01-REQ-057 (Turn limit)**: If the configured `maxTurns` is reached and the game has not ended by another condition, the game ends. Scores are computed from alive snake lengths at that turn. The team with the highest score wins; ties are permitted.

**01-REQ-058**: A `maxTurns` of zero or absent means no turn limit; the game continues until last-team-standing or simultaneous elimination.

---

### 1.10 Randomness

**01-REQ-059**: All random operations during game setup (hazard placement, fertile tile generation, territory angular offset, snake starting positions, parity choice, initial food placement) shall use a randomness source seeded from a per-game seed. This seed shall not be accessible to any game client.

**01-REQ-060**: All random operations during turn resolution (food spawn locations, potion spawn locations) shall use a randomness source seeded from a per-turn seed. This seed shall not be accessible to any game client.

---

### 1.11 Game Configuration Parameter Ranges

**01-REQ-063 (Board size range)**: `boardSize` shall be one of `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, or `Giant` as defined by the `BoardSize` enum (01-REQ-003). No additional constraint beyond the type is required.

**01-REQ-064 (Snakes per team range)**: `snakesPerTeam` shall be an integer in the range 1–10, default 5 (consistent with 01-REQ-019).

**01-REQ-065 (Max health range)**: `maxHealth` shall be an integer in the range 1–500, default 100. The lower bound ensures snakes can take at least one hit; the upper bound prevents degenerate immortality configurations.

**01-REQ-066 (Max turns range)**: `maxTurns` shall be 0 (disabled, per 01-REQ-058) or an integer in the range 1–1000, default 100. The upper bound prevents excessively long games.

**01-REQ-067 (Hazard percentage range)**: `hazardPercentage` shall be an integer in the range 0–30, default 0 (informal spec §9.3).

**01-REQ-068 (Hazard damage range)**: `hazardDamage` shall be an integer in the range 1–100, default 15 (informal spec §9.3).

**01-REQ-069 (Fertile ground density range)**: `fertileGround.density` shall be an integer in the range 0–90, default 30 (informal spec §9.3). A value of 0 disables fertile ground (no cell is marked `CellType.Fertile` during board generation and food spawning is not restricted to Fertile cells); any positive value enables it with the specified density percentage. See resolved **01-REVIEW-017**.

**01-REQ-070 (Fertile ground clustering range)**: `fertileGround.clustering` shall be an integer in the range 1–20, default 10 (informal spec §9.3). Has no effect when `fertileGround.density` is 0.

**01-REQ-071 (Food spawn rate range)**: `foodSpawnRate` shall be a number in the range 0–5, default 0.5 (informal spec §9.3).

**01-REQ-072 (Invulnerability potion spawn rate range)**: `invulnPotionSpawnRate` shall be a number in the range 0–0.2, default 0.15 (informal spec §9.3). A value of 0 disables invulnerability potions (none ever spawn); any positive value within [0.01, 0.2] yields the standard probabilistic spawn mechanic of 01-REQ-049. Values in `(0, 0.01)` are permitted by the type but operationally indistinguishable from a very rare rate. See resolved **01-REVIEW-017**.

**01-REQ-073 (Invisibility potion spawn rate range)**: `invisPotionSpawnRate` shall be a number in the range 0–0.2, default 0.1 (informal spec §9.3). A value of 0 disables invisibility potions (none ever spawn); any positive value within [0.01, 0.2] yields the standard probabilistic spawn mechanic of 01-REQ-049. See resolved **01-REVIEW-017**.

**01-REQ-074 (Initial time budget range)**: `clock.initialBudgetMs` shall be an integer in the range 0–600000 (0–10 minutes), default 60000 (informal spec §9.3). Zero means no initial budget.

**01-REQ-075 (Budget increment range)**: `clock.budgetIncrementMs` shall be an integer in the range 100–5000, default 500 (informal spec §9.3).

**01-REQ-076 (First turn time range)**: `clock.firstTurnTimeMs` shall be an integer in the range 1000–300000, default 60000. The lower bound of 1000ms is higher than `maxTurnTimeMs`'s 100ms floor because the first turn involves initial orientation and should not be blitz-constrained.

**01-REQ-077 (Max turn time range)**: `clock.maxTurnTimeMs` shall be an integer in the range 100–300000, default 10000. The lower bound of 100ms supports blitz-style play configurations.

See resolved **01-REVIEW-012**.

## Design

The Design section specifies *how* the requirements are satisfied. It cites requirement IDs throughout. Type definitions here are drafts that the Exported Interfaces section then elevates to the module's contract; where a type appears in both, the Exported Interfaces version is authoritative.

### 2.1 Domain Type Vocabulary

Implements 01-REQ-001 through 01-REQ-007.

```typescript

**Invisibility as information asymmetry only** (01-REQ-024). `isVisible(snake) = false` has no effect on collision detection, severing, health ticks, or any other turn-resolution mechanic — those phases operate against the full live state. The derived value exists exclusively to support filtering at the observation boundary: module 04's RLS rules use it to hide invisible snakes from opponent-team subscribers, and module 09's spectator views respect the same filter. The turn-resolution pseudocode in Section 2.8 never computes `isVisible(snake)` during Phases 1–8; it is only consulted by observation-boundary code.

**Derived values, not stored fields** (01-REQ-022, 01-REQ-023). `invulnerabilityLevel ∈ {-1, 0, +1}` and `isVisible` are pure O(k) functions over `activeEffects` with k ≤ 2 per 01-REQ-028; consumers call the exported `invulnerabilityLevel(snake)` and `isVisible(snake)` helpers from Section 3.1. See resolved **01-REVIEW-014** and **01-REVIEW-015**.

**Invisibility collector remains visible** (01-REQ-023). The active collector of the invisibility family holds `(invisibility, debuff)` and is therefore `isVisible(snake) = true`. Their teammates who hold `(invisibility, buff)` are invisible to opponents. The collector is the visible "weak link" opponents can target to disrupt their team's invisibility — this is the whole point of the collector role and is symmetric to the invulnerability collector's `invulnerabilityLevel = -1` vulnerability. See resolved **01-REVIEW-016**.

### 2.2 Board Geometry

Implements 01-REQ-003, 01-REQ-008, 01-REQ-009.

```typescript
export const enum BoardSize { Small = 0, Medium = 1, Large = 2, Giant = 3 }

// Fixed per 01-REQ-003
export const BOARD_DIMENSIONS: Readonly<Record<BoardSize, { total: number; playable: number }>> = {
  [BoardSize.Small]:  { total: 11, playable: 9  },
  [BoardSize.Medium]: { total: 13, playable: 11 },
  [BoardSize.Large]:  { total: 17, playable: 15 },
  [BoardSize.Giant]:  { total: 21, playable: 19 },
}

// Flat row-major cell array. Flat layout chosen over nested arrays for
// cache locality — collision detection and hazard lookup are the hot path.
export interface Board {
  readonly size: BoardSize
  readonly width: number                       // = total
  readonly height: number                      // = total (boards are square)
  readonly cells: ReadonlyArray<CellType>      // length = width * height
}

export function cellIndex(board: Board, cell: Cell): number {
  return cell.y * board.width + cell.x
}

export function isInner(board: Board, cell: Cell): boolean {
  return cell.x > 0 && cell.x < board.width - 1
      && cell.y > 0 && cell.y < board.height - 1
}

export function parityOf(cell: Cell): 0 | 1 {
  return ((cell.x + cell.y) & 1) as 0 | 1
}

export function fertileGroundEnabled(board: Board): boolean {
  return board.cells.includes(CellType.Fertile)
}
```

`fertileGroundEnabled(board)` is the canonical predicate for whether fertile-ground food-eligibility restriction applies. Runtime consumers (Phase 7 food spawning per [01-REQ-048]) must derive the answer from the board rather than the config because `config.orchestration.fertileGround.density` is not forwarded to SpacetimeDB (see resolved [01-REVIEW-017]) — the board itself is the authoritative record of whether fertile-ground generation ran. The predicate is a pure function of `Board` and `Board.cells` is static for the lifetime of a game, so implementations may cache the result at init time; the observable value never changes across turns.

Direction semantics:

| Direction | Δx | Δy |
|-----------|----|----|
| `Up`      |  0 | −1 |
| `Right`   | +1 |  0 |
| `Down`    |  0 | +1 |
| `Left`    | −1 |  0 |

### 2.3 Randomness & Seed Derivation

Implements 01-REQ-059, 01-REQ-060, 01-REQ-061.

**PRNG**: Xoshiro256++. Chosen over `Math.random` (non-reproducible), Mulberry32 (32-bit state, insufficient for thousands of turns of per-turn reseeding), and SplitMix64 (acceptable but weaker statistical quality than Xoshiro). Xoshiro256++ has a 256-bit state that maps naturally to a 32-byte seed.

**Game seed**: 32 bytes, generated at game provisioning time, stored in the module-04 static configuration, not exposed to any client (01-REQ-059).

**Sub-seed derivation** (resolving 01-REVIEW-007's explicit deferral): given a parent seed `s` (32 bytes) and a UTF-8 context tag `t`, the sub-seed is

```
subSeed(s, t) = BLAKE3(key = s, input = t).firstBytes(32)
```

BLAKE3's keyed-hash mode gives a PRF whose output has strong uniformity properties, making it suitable for reseeding both Xoshiro and the Perlin noise offset. The requirement is only that the derivation be deterministic and reproducible from the game seed plus attempt index; BLAKE3 is a specific choice rather than the only valid one (see DOWNSTREAM IMPACT note 4).

Defined context tags:

| Context tag                | Purpose                                                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"board-attempt:{0..3}"`   | Per-retry board-generation seed (01-REQ-061)                     |
| `"hazards"`                | Hazard placement within an attempt                               |
| `"fertile"`                | Fertile tile noise sampling                                      |
| `"territory-angle"`        | Angular offset for team territories (01-REQ-014)                 |
| `"territory-tiebreak"`     | Tie-break for boundary cells on sector edges                     |
| `"parity"`                 | Parity choice (01-REQ-016)                                       |
| `"starting-positions"`     | Per-team head placement                                          |
| `"initial-food"`           | Initial food placement (01-REQ-017)                              |
| `"turn:{N}"`               | Per-turn seed for turn N (01-REQ-060)                            |
| `"phase-1-random"`         | Turn-0 random direction choice (01-REQ-042)                      |
| `"phase-7-food"`           | Food spawning randomness                                         |
| `"phase-8-potions"`        | Potion spawning randomness                                       |

The per-turn seed is derived as `subSeed(gameSeed, "turn:" + turnNumber)`; phase-level sub-seeds within a turn are then derived from that per-turn seed.

```typescript
export interface Rng {
  nextU32(): number
  nextFloat(): number                  // [0, 1)
  nextIntExclusive(maxExclusive: number): number
  pick<T>(items: ReadonlyArray<T>): T
  shuffle<T>(items: T[]): void         // in place, Fisher–Yates
}

export function rngFromSeed(seed: Uint8Array): Rng
export function subSeed(parent: Uint8Array, tag: string): Uint8Array
```

### 2.4 Board Generation Pipeline

Implements 01-REQ-010 through 01-REQ-017 and 01-REQ-061. A single *attempt* runs the six stages below using the current attempt's sub-seed; the attempt either succeeds or fails atomically.

**Stage 1 — Hazards** (01-REQ-010, 01-REQ-011). Using `subSeed(attemptSeed, "hazards")`:

1. `hazardCount = floor(innerCellCount * config.hazardPercentage / 100)`.
2. Sample `hazardCount` inner cells uniformly without replacement. Mark them `CellType.Hazard`.
3. Run BFS from any non-hazard inner cell over the graph of non-hazard, non-wall inner cells (4-connectivity). If BFS does not visit every non-hazard inner cell, the attempt **fails** with code `HAZARD_CONNECTIVITY`.

**Stage 2 — Fertile tiles** (01-REQ-012, 01-REQ-013): only runs if `config.fertileGround.density > 0`. Per Section 2.5 below. Marks selected cells `CellType.Fertile`. A fertile cell is never simultaneously a hazard because the candidate pool excludes hazards.

**Stage 3 — Territory angular offset** (01-REQ-014). Using `subSeed(attemptSeed, "territory-angle")`: sample `theta0 ∈ [0, 2π)` uniformly. For an N-team game the sector boundaries are `theta0 + k·(2π/N)` for `k = 0..N-1`. Each inner cell is assigned to the sector containing the point `(x + 0.5, y + 0.5)` (the cell centre). The "overlaps most" phrasing of 01-REQ-014 simplifies here to "sector containing the centre" because sectors have straight-line boundaries and inner cells are unit squares — the sector containing the centre is always the one with the largest overlap. Boundary-centre ties (measure-zero but possible under exact rational arithmetic) are broken using `subSeed(attemptSeed, "territory-tiebreak")`.

**Stage 4 — Parity choice** (01-REQ-016). Using `subSeed(attemptSeed, "parity")`: sample parity ∈ {0, 1} uniformly.

**Stage 5 — Starting positions** (01-REQ-015). Using `subSeed(attemptSeed, "starting-positions")`:

1. For each team `t`, build candidate set `C_t` = inner cells in team `t`'s territory that are (a) not Wall, (b) not Hazard, (c) of the chosen parity.
2. If any `|C_t| < config.snakesPerTeam`, the attempt **fails** with code `TERRITORY_PARITY_SHORTAGE` and records the offending team ID.
3. Otherwise, for each team sample `snakesPerTeam` distinct cells from `C_t` without replacement; these become head starting positions.

**Stage 6 — Initial food placement** (01-REQ-017). Using `subSeed(attemptSeed, "initial-food")`:

1. `E` = inner cells that are (a) not Wall, (b) not Hazard, (c) not occupied by any snake body segment. (At game start each snake's three segments all stack on the starting cell, so that single cell is marked occupied.)
2. If `config.fertileGround.density > 0`, restrict `E` further to Fertile cells.
3. If `|E| < totalSnakeCount`, the attempt **fails** with code `INITIAL_FOOD_SHORTAGE`.
4. Otherwise sample `totalSnakeCount` distinct cells from `E` and spawn one Food item per cell.

**Retry loop** (01-REQ-061): `attemptIndex` starts at 0. On failure, increment and re-derive `attemptSeed = subSeed(gameSeed, "board-attempt:" + attemptIndex)`, then rerun stages 1–6 from scratch. The loop runs up to 4 attempts (`attemptIndex ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}`). If attempt 3 fails, surface:

```typescript
export interface BoardGenerationFailure {
  readonly code: 'HAZARD_CONNECTIVITY' | 'TERRITORY_PARITY_SHORTAGE' | 'INITIAL_FOOD_SHORTAGE'
  readonly attemptsUsed: 4
  readonly details: {
    readonly centaurTeamId?: CentaurTeamId
    readonly innerCellCount: number
    readonly eligibleCellCount?: number
  }
}
```

This structure satisfies the "machine-readable error identifying which constraint failed" obligation of 01-REQ-061. The room owner can then reconfigure and re-provision.

### 2.5 Fertile Tile Noise Spec

Implements 01-REQ-013. Given clustering `C ∈ [1, 20]` and density `D ∈ [1, 90]`:

1. **Base frequency** via log-linear mapping from `C`:
   ```
   baseFreq = 2 ** lerp(log2(1.0), log2(1/32), (C - 1) / 19)
   ```
   At `C = 1`, base period ≈ 1 cell (high frequency → scattered flecks). At `C = 20`, base period ≈ 32 cells (low frequency → contiguous blobs). Log-linear because human perception of spatial frequency is logarithmic; a linear mapping would visually compress most of the slider range into the low-clustering half.

2. **Noise score per inner non-Wall non-Hazard cell `(x, y)`**:
   - Derive a random 2D offset `(dx, dy) ∈ [0, 1024) × [0, 1024)` from `subSeed(attemptSeed, "fertile")` so the noise field shifts every game.
   - 4-octave fractal Perlin:
     ```
     sum = 0; amp = 1; freq = baseFreq; norm = 0
     for i in 0..3:
       sum  += amp * perlin((x + dx) * freq, (y + dy) * freq)
       norm += amp
       amp  *= 0.5
       freq *= 2
     score = sum / norm                 // ≈ [-1, 1]
     ```
   Each octave doubles frequency and halves amplitude per 01-REQ-013.

3. **Candidate pool**: all inner cells that are not Wall and not Hazard. Sort by score descending. Tie-break deterministically by `(y, x)` ascending.

4. **Selection**: take the top `ceil(|candidates| * D / 100)` cells. `ceil` rather than `floor` so that `D = 1` on small boards still yields at least one fertile cell, matching the intuitive meaning of a non-zero density knob.

**Perlin vs. alternatives**: Value noise produces visibly grid-aligned patches; simplex noise is advantageous only in ≥3 dimensions. 2D Perlin is the right level of complexity for this use case.

### 2.6 Snake Initialization

Implements 01-REQ-018 through 01-REQ-021.

1. For each team in team-registration order, assign letters consecutively starting at `'A'`. Display name is `${centaurTeamName}.${letter}` (01-REQ-018).
2. Assign the starting cells produced by Section 2.4 Stage 5 to the team's snakes in an order determined by a per-team Fisher–Yates shuffle drawn from the same `"starting-positions"` sub-seed.
3. For each snake:
   - `body = [startCell, startCell, startCell]` (length 3 with all segments stacked, per 01-REQ-020).
   - `health = config.maxHealth`.
   - `activeEffects = []`, `pendingEffects = []` — derived `invulnerabilityLevel(snake) = 0` and `isVisible(snake) = true`.
   - `lastDirection = null`.
   - `alive = true`, `ateLastTurn = false`.

### 2.7 Effect State Machine

Implements 01-REQ-022, 01-REQ-023, 01-REQ-028, 01-REQ-031, 01-REQ-033, 01-REQ-050, and the expiry semantics resolved in 01-REVIEW-003.

**Effect model: symmetric buff/debuff states**. Each potion family (`invulnerability`, `invisibility`) has two possible states on a snake: `buff` or `debuff`. A snake holds at most one active effect per family (01-REQ-028). The two families are independent; a snake can hold any combination of `{none, buff, debuff} × {none, buff, debuff}` across the two families. Effects are stored as members of an `activeEffects` collection on `SnakeState`, with each member carrying `(family, state, expiryTurn)`. The flat collection form supports uniform iteration over all current effects. See resolved **01-REVIEW-015**.

The per-family single-effect invariant is maintained by two mechanisms:

1. **Phase 6 team rebuild** (01-REQ-047): when any member of a team collects a potion of family F, the entire team's family-F state is rewritten as a single coherent pending rebuild — every alive member gets exactly one pending `(F, state)` entry. This replaces whatever family-F state the team previously had.
2. **Phase 9 replace-semantics application** (01-REQ-050): when the rebuild is applied, Phase 9 first removes any existing active-F effect on each affected snake before inserting the new one. This preserves the "≤1 per family" invariant even if the snake's previous effect hadn't yet expired.

**Derived values, not stored fields** (01-REQ-022, 01-REQ-023):

```
invulnerabilityLevel(snake) =
  +1  if snake.activeEffects has (invulnerability, buff)
  -1  if snake.activeEffects has (invulnerability, debuff)
   0  otherwise

isVisible(snake) =
  false  if snake.activeEffects has (invisibility, buff)
  true   otherwise  // including the case of (invisibility, debuff)
```

These are the *only* reads used by collision resolution in Phase 3. No cached fields, no denormalisation.

**Effect immutability as a structural invariant** (01-REQ-033). The design satisfies 01-REQ-033 structurally: no phase between start-of-turn and Phase 9 writes to `activeEffects`. The live `activeEffects` list therefore equals its start-of-turn value throughout Phases 1–8 by invariant. The derived `invulnerabilityLevel(snake)` and `isVisible(snake)` helpers called during Phase 3 and Phase 9a consequently return start-of-turn values by construction. See resolved **01-REVIEW-014**.

**Correctness-critical invariant**:

> During Phases 1–8 of turn resolution, no code path may write to `snake.activeEffects`. Phase 6 writes to `snake.pendingEffects` only; `pendingEffects` is a separate list that does not influence any effect read. Phase 9 is the sole writer of `activeEffects`.

Future edits that need to mutate effect state mid-turn must either (a) be placed at or after Phase 9, or (b) explicitly take an effect snapshot at the start of Phase 1 and reroute pre-mutation reads through it, reintroducing the snapshot at that point. See DOWNSTREAM IMPACT note 9.

**Effect duration encoding** (resolving 01-REVIEW-003). For a potion collected on turn T:

1. Phase 6 of turn T: the collecting team's family-F pending rebuild is scheduled, with every member receiving `PotionEffect { family: F, state, expiryTurn: T + 3 }` in `pendingEffects`.
2. Phase 9 of turn T: cancellations from 9a apply first (see below), then the pending rebuild is applied to `activeEffects` with replace-semantics — the effect becomes live but doesn't influence same-turn behaviour because turn T's collision and disruption reads have already completed.
3. Phase 9 of turn T+3: the expiry pass removes any effect where `currentTurn >= expiryTurn`. Here `currentTurn = T+3` and `expiryTurn = T+3`, so the effect is removed. Because the removal happens *after* turn T+3's Phases 1–8 have already read `activeEffects`, the effect is active on turns T+1, T+2, T+3 — three turns as required.

**Re-collection refreshes, does not stack**. If a team already holds an active invulnerability-family rebuild from turn T₀ and re-collects on turn T₁ > T₀, the new rebuild's `expiryTurn = T₁ + 3` unconditionally replaces the previous family-F state on every team member. This is consistent with the "replace on apply" semantics in 01-REQ-047. A debuff-holder who re-collects the same family remains the debuff-holder (their name appears in this turn's `collectorsInTurn` set).

**Cancellation semantics** (01-REQ-031). When a snake holding `(family = F, state = debuff)` suffers a disruption during turn T:

- Phase 4 records the cancellation obligation for family F on that snake's team.
- Phase 9a applies the cancellation before the rebuild/expiry passes: every active family-F effect is removed from every alive member of the team, and every pending family-F entry scheduled this turn for that team is discarded. Other families are untouched.
- If the disrupted snake holds both `(invulnerability, debuff)` and `(invisibility, debuff)` simultaneously, both families are cancelled independently.

See resolved **01-REVIEW-010** and **01-REVIEW-015** for the rationale behind the family-scoped, attribution-free cancellation model.

**Disruption buffer**. Phases 3, 5, and 6 append to a `disruptionBuffer: DisruptionRecord[]`:

```typescript
interface DisruptionRecord {
  readonly snakeId: SnakeId
  readonly cause:
    | 'wall_death'     | 'self_death'    | 'body_collision_death'
    | 'severed'        | 'severing_other'| 'body_collision_received'
    | 'head_to_head_death' | 'hazard_entry' | 'starvation'
}
```

Phase 9a reads this buffer to compute cancellation scope.

### 2.8 Turn Resolution Pipeline

Implements 01-REQ-041 through 01-REQ-052 and 01-REQ-062. Pseudocode below; `state` is the mutable game state, `T` is the current turn number, `turnSeed = subSeed(gameSeed, "turn:" + T)`.

```text

  moves = {}   # snakeId → { direction: Direction, stagedBy: Agent | null }
  rngP1 = rngFromSeed(subSeed(turnSeed, "phase-1-random"))
  for snake in aliveSnakes(state):
    if stagedMoves.has(snake.snakeId):
      sm = stagedMoves.get(snake.snakeId)
      moves[snake.snakeId] = { direction: sm.direction, stagedBy: sm.stagedBy }
    elif snake.lastDirection != null:
      moves[snake.snakeId] = { direction: snake.lastDirection, stagedBy: null }

  # 9b. Apply pending rebuilds with replace-semantics. Any pending entry that
  #     survived 9a is applied; it overwrites any prior active entry of the
  #     same family on the same snake. Because Phase 6 writes at most one
  #     pending entry per family per snake per turn, this loop processes at
  #     most two pending entries per snake.
  for snake in allSnakes(state):
    for pe in snake.pendingEffects:
      removeActiveOfFamily(snake, pe.family)
      snake.activeEffects = [...snake.activeEffects, pe]
    snake.pendingEffects = []

  # ---------- Phase 11: Event Emission (01-REQ-052) ----------
  emitEvents(turnEventBuffer)

  return { nextState: state, events: turnEventBuffer, outcome }
```

**Phase 9 ordering rationale**. The sequence is *cancel (9a) → apply pending rebuilds with replace-semantics (9b) → expire (9c)*. Alternative orderings were considered:

- **Apply-then-cancel** would expose newly-pending effects from Phase 6 collection to cancellation by same-turn disruption. 01-REQ-033 requires debuff-holder identification against start-of-turn state; a snake that collected for the first time this turn holds no debuff at start-of-turn and is therefore not a cancellation trigger. Per Section 2.7's invariant, `snake.activeEffects` still equals its start-of-turn value at step 9a, so the cancellation pass reads it directly. Cancelling before applying rebuilds is what preserves that equality at 9a's read sites.
- **Expire-then-cancel** would wrongly skip cancellation for a debuff-holder whose debuff expires the same turn as the disruption: the expiry pass would strip the debuff before 9a could read it. The pseudocode avoids this by running 9a first.
- **Cancel-then-expire-then-apply** (swapping 9b and 9c) would be observably equivalent to the chosen order in all cases because (i) the rebuild's `expiryTurn = T + 3` is always strictly greater than the current turn `T`, so the new entry cannot be expired by 9c regardless of position, and (ii) 9a's cancellation already stripped any family-F entries the rebuild replaces, so the `removeActiveOfFamily` in 9b is a no-op for freshly-cancelled families. Chosen order is cleaner to read.

**Phase 3 simultaneity** (resolved 01-REVIEW-002). The body-collision loop iterates against the post-Phase-2 `bodies` snapshot regardless of which snakes are being added to `deaths` in the same phase; this means snake B can sever or body-collide with snake A's body even if A is itself dying from a wall or self-collision in the same Phase 3. The pseudocode achieves this by computing `heads`/`bodies` once at phase start and not mutating them as deaths accumulate.

**Growth observability** (01-REQ-062). `ateLastTurn = true` set in Phase 5c of turn T causes Phase 2 of turn T+1 to retain the old tail. The body-length comparison `end-of-Phase-2(T+1) − end-of-Phase-2(T) === +1` is directly observable via the `snake_moved.grew` boolean in the turn event stream.

**Food-on-hazard coexistence** (01-REQ-046c). The pseudocode applies hazard damage (5b) before food healing (5c); the net health after a snake enters a food-on-hazard cell with health `h` is `max(h - 1 - hazardDamage, ...) → MaxHealth` via the food heal overriding the damaged value. Importantly, the hazard *entry disruption* is still recorded in 5b, so a collector entering a food-on-hazard cell still loses its stacks at Phase 9 (01-REQ-046c's explicit note).

### 2.9 Chess Timer

Implements 01-REQ-034 through 01-REQ-040. Per-team clock state:

```typescript
export interface CentaurTeamClockState {
  readonly centaurTeamId: CentaurTeamId
  readonly budgetMs: number          // persistent across turns (01-REQ-034, 01-REQ-035)
  readonly perTurnMs: number         // current turn only (01-REQ-037)
  readonly declaredTurnOver: boolean
}
```

**At turn start** for each team (01-REQ-036, 01-REQ-037):

```
budgetMs  += config.clock.budgetIncrementMs
cap        = (T === 0) ? config.clock.firstTurnTimeMs : config.clock.maxTurnTimeMs
perTurnMs  = min(cap, budgetMs)
declaredTurnOver = false
```

**On explicit declare-turn-over** (01-REQ-038):

```
budgetMs += perTurnMs      # credit unspent time back to the budget
perTurnMs = 0
declaredTurnOver = true
```

**On clock expiry** (01-REQ-039): automatically invoke the declare-turn-over sequence when real-time elapsed causes `perTurnMs` to reach zero; the credit-back is a no-op because `perTurnMs === 0`.

**Turn resolution trigger** (01-REQ-040): `resolveTurn(...)` is invoked when every team has `declaredTurnOver === true`.

Module 01 only specifies the *arithmetic* of the clock. The physical mechanism — how real-time elapsing mutates `perTurnMs` — is a module-04 concern. This is **DOWNSTREAM IMPACT** note 6.

### 2.10 Win Condition Evaluation

Implements 01-REQ-053 through 01-REQ-058. Phase 10 at the end of turn T:

```
aliveTeams = teams with ≥1 alive snake after Phase 9 of turn T
scores(t)  = sum of body.length over alive snakes in team t

if aliveTeams.length === 0:
  # Simultaneous elimination (01-REQ-055, 01-REQ-056)
  if T === 0:
    # Every snake began at length 3 (01-REQ-020). `initialSnakeCount(t)` is the
    # number of snakes team `t` had at game start, derived from the initial
    # GameState that STDB was initialized with; `snakesPerTeam` is an
    # orchestration-side parameter (GameOrchestrationConfig) and is not
    # retained at runtime. See resolved 01-REVIEW-017.
    initialScores(t) = 3 * initialSnakeCount(t)
    return winnerOrDraw(initialScores)
  else:
    return winnerOrDraw(previousTurnScores)

if aliveTeams.length === 1:
  return { kind: 'victory', winnerCentaurTeamId: aliveTeams[0], scores }  # 01-REQ-054

if config.maxTurns > 0 and T === config.maxTurns - 1:
  return winnerOrDraw(scores)                                      # 01-REQ-057

return { kind: 'in_progress' }                                     # 01-REQ-058 (no limit)
```

Where `winnerOrDraw(scoreMap)` returns `{kind: 'victory', ...}` if there is a unique maximum, else `{kind: 'draw', tiedCentaurTeamIds: [...]}`.

**Previous-turn scores**: before Phase 1 of every turn, the engine snapshots the current team scores (computed from alive snakes at start-of-turn, which equals end-of-previous-turn) into `previousTurnScores` for use by the simultaneous-elimination branch. Module 01 specifies the arithmetic; the storage location is a module-04 concern.

**Turn limit boundary**: `maxTurns` is the count of turns played, so the game ends at the end of turn `maxTurns - 1`. `maxTurns = 0` means no limit (01-REQ-058).

### 2.11 Turn Event Schema

Implements 01-REQ-052. Closed discriminated union:

```typescript
export type DeathCause =
  | 'wall' | 'self_collision' | 'body_collision' | 'head_to_head' | 'starvation' | 'hazard'

export type TurnEvent =
  | {
      readonly kind: 'snake_moved'
      readonly snakeId: SnakeId
      readonly from: Cell
      readonly to: Cell
      readonly direction: Direction
      readonly grew: boolean
      // null when no move was staged this turn — i.e. Phase 1 fell through
      // to `lastDirection` or, on turn 0, to the deterministic random pick.
      // Team attribution is not carried on the event because it is derivable
      // from `snakeId` via `SnakeState.centaurTeamId`.
      readonly stagedBy: Agent | null
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'snake_died'
      readonly snakeId: SnakeId
      readonly cause: DeathCause
      readonly killerSnakeId: SnakeId | null
      readonly location: Cell
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'snake_severed'
      readonly attackerSnakeId: SnakeId
      readonly victimSnakeId: SnakeId
      readonly contactCell: Cell
      readonly segmentsLost: number
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'food_eaten'
      readonly snakeId: SnakeId
      readonly cell: Cell
      readonly healthRestored: number
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'potion_collected'
      readonly snakeId: SnakeId
      readonly cell: Cell
      readonly potionType: ItemType.InvulnPotion | ItemType.InvisPotion
      readonly affectedTeammateIds: ReadonlyArray<SnakeId>
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'food_spawned'
      readonly itemId: ItemId
      readonly cell: Cell
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'potion_spawned'
      readonly itemId: ItemId
      readonly cell: Cell
      readonly potionType: ItemType.InvulnPotion | ItemType.InvisPotion
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'effect_applied'
      readonly snakeId: SnakeId
      readonly family: EffectFamily
      readonly state: EffectState
      readonly expiryTurn: TurnNumber
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'effect_cancelled'
      readonly snakeId: SnakeId
      readonly family: EffectFamily
      readonly reason: 'collector_disruption' | 'expiry' | 'replaced'
    }
```

**Ordering**: events are emitted in phase order (1 → 11), and within a phase in ascending `snakeId` order. This determinism lets replay viewers render without re-sorting.

**Scoping note**. Module 01 owns the *closed enumeration of event kinds and their payload shapes* because these trace directly from turn-resolution semantics (01-REQ-052). Module 04 owns the storage representation (append-only `turn_events` table, keyed by `(turn, eventIndex)`). Downstream modules that see a concrete identity type (most notably module 04's SpacetimeDB `Identity`) are responsible for mapping that identity to an `Agent` variant before passing staged moves into `resolveTurn`. See resolved **01-REVIEW-011**.

## Exported Interfaces

This section is the minimal contract module 01 exposes to downstream modules. Any type not listed here is a module-internal detail and may change without a version bump.

// member of a Centaur Team, identified via Google OAuth).
// The `CentaurTeamId` and `UserId` id spaces are disjoint and opaque to

### 3.3 Game Configuration

Motivated by 01-REQ-003, 01-REQ-010, 01-REQ-013, 01-REQ-019, 01-REQ-034–040, 01-REQ-046b, 01-REQ-048, 01-REQ-049, 01-REQ-057, 01-REQ-063–077. Numeric ranges are pinned by canonical range requirements 01-REQ-063–077 (see resolved **01-REVIEW-012**) drawing from the informal spec's §9.3 game configuration table. The split between `GameOrchestrationConfig` and `GameRuntimeConfig` traces the boundary between fields consumed only on the platform side (board generation and lifecycle orchestration) and fields consumed by the per-turn engine (see resolved **01-REVIEW-017**).

**Schema-mirroring constraints**. The three types above are the canonical TypeScript schema. To make the same shape declarable in both SpacetimeDB (`@type` classes mirroring each interface) and Convex (`v.object({…})` validators with `Infer<typeof v> ≡ GameConfig`) without translation, the following constraints hold throughout: every numeric field is `number` (no `bigint`/`Int64`); no field is `null` or absent in value position (sentinels — `maxTurns: 0`, `fertileGround.density: 0`, `foodSpawnRate: 0`, `invulnPotionSpawnRate: 0`, `invisPotionSpawnRate: 0` — encode "disabled"); enums are string-literal unions (`BoardSize`); time values are milliseconds; nested object grouping carries semantic meaning rather than syntactic optionality (e.g., `fertileGround` bundles the two board-gen knobs that parameterise one feature; `clock` bundles the four chess-timer knobs). See resolved **01-REVIEW-017**.

### 3.4 Game Outcome

Motivated by 01-REQ-051, 01-REQ-053–058.

```typescript
export type GameOutcome =
  | { readonly kind: 'in_progress' }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'victory'
      readonly winnerCentaurTeamId: CentaurTeamId
      readonly scores: ReadonlyMap<CentaurTeamId, number>
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'draw'
      readonly tiedCentaurTeamIds: ReadonlyArray<CentaurTeamId>
      readonly scores: ReadonlyMap<CentaurTeamId, number>
    }
  | {
      readonly kind: 'error'
      readonly reason: string
    }
```

### 3.5 Turn Event Schema

Motivated by 01-REQ-052. Full type as defined in Section 2.11 (`TurnEvent`, `DeathCause`).

### 3.6 Board Generation Failure

Motivated by 01-REQ-061.

```typescript
export interface BoardGenerationFailure {
  readonly code: 'HAZARD_CONNECTIVITY' | 'TERRITORY_PARITY_SHORTAGE' | 'INITIAL_FOOD_SHORTAGE'
  readonly attemptsUsed: 4
  readonly details: {
    readonly centaurTeamId?: CentaurTeamId
    readonly innerCellCount: number
    readonly eligibleCellCount?: number
  }
}
```

### 3.7 Randomness Primitives

Motivated by 01-REQ-059, 01-REQ-060, 01-REQ-061.

```typescript
export interface Rng {
  nextU32(): number
  nextFloat(): number
  nextIntExclusive(maxExclusive: number): number
  pick<T>(items: ReadonlyArray<T>): T
  shuffle<T>(items: T[]): void
}

export function rngFromSeed(seed: Uint8Array): Rng
export function subSeed(parent: Uint8Array, tag: string): Uint8Array
```

### 3.8 Entry Points

Motivated by 01-REQ-010–017 + 01-REQ-061 (board gen) and 01-REQ-041–052 + 01-REQ-062 (turn resolution).

```typescript
export function generateBoardAndInitialState(
  config: GameOrchestrationConfig,
  teams: ReadonlyArray<{ readonly centaurTeamId: CentaurTeamId; readonly name: string }>,
  gameSeed: Uint8Array,
): { readonly board: Board; readonly snakes: ReadonlyArray<SnakeState>;
     readonly items: ReadonlyArray<ItemState> }
  | BoardGenerationFailure

export interface StagedMove {
  readonly direction: Direction
  readonly stagedBy: Agent   // never null on input; absence is represented by
                             // omitting the entry from the `stagedMoves` map
}

export function resolveTurn(
  state: GameState,
  stagedMoves: ReadonlyMap<SnakeId, StagedMove>,
  turnNumber: TurnNumber,
  turnSeed: Uint8Array,
): {
  readonly nextState: GameState
  readonly events: ReadonlyArray<TurnEvent>
  readonly outcome: GameOutcome
}

```

```typescript
export interface GameState {
  readonly board: Board
  readonly snakes: ReadonlyArray<SnakeState>
  readonly items: ReadonlyArray<ItemState>
  readonly clocks: ReadonlyArray<CentaurTeamClockState>
}
```

`GameState` is the concrete aggregate of the four game-state components. It is the input and output type for `resolveTurn` and is exported so that downstream modules (especially Module 04) use a single canonical shape rather than defining their own aggregates independently. See resolved **01-REVIEW-013**.

### 3.9 Invariants and Constants

- Wall border is exactly 1 cell thick on every side (01-REQ-008).
- Playable area dimensions per `BoardSize` are fixed by `BOARD_DIMENSIONS` (01-REQ-003).
- Snake starting length is exactly 3 segments, all stacked on the starting cell (01-REQ-020).
- `PotionEffect.expiryTurn` is the last turn on which the effect is active; Phase 9 removes when `currentTurn >= expiryTurn` (resolved 01-REVIEW-003).
- A snake holds at most one active and at most one pending effect per family (01-REQ-028, 01-REQ-047). Stacking is not supported.
- `invulnerabilityLevel(snake) ∈ {-1, 0, +1}` and `isVisible(snake)` are pure O(k≤2) functions over `activeEffects`; they are the only reads collision resolution performs (01-REQ-022, 01-REQ-023, 01-REQ-044c, 01-REQ-044d).
- Disruption of a debuff-holder cancels that family team-wide; other families are untouched (01-REQ-031). Both debuff-holders (invulnerability and invisibility) remain visible — the invisibility-family debuff-holder is explicitly visible to opponents as the targetable weak link for their team's invisibility buff.
- Turn event ordering within a turn is deterministic: phase ascending, then `snakeId` ascending.
- `fertileGroundEnabled(board)` is the canonical runtime predicate for whether Phase 7 food eligibility restricts to `CellType.Fertile` cells (01-REQ-048). The predicate is derived from the board — not the game config — because `config.orchestration.fertileGround` is not forwarded to STDB; the board's cells are the authoritative record (resolved 01-REVIEW-017). The value is constant for the lifetime of the game since the board is static after generation.

### 3.10 DOWNSTREAM IMPACT Notes

1. **Event schema is closed.** Modules 04, 08, 09 can rely on the nine `TurnEvent` kinds being exhaustive. Adding a new kind requires a coordinated change across every consumer and a module-01 version bump.

2. **Effect schema is `PotionEffect { family, state, expiryTurn }`, no source attribution.** Module 04's schema must carry exactly these three fields. Adding back per-stack attribution would require reintroducing stacking. See resolved 01-REVIEW-010 and 01-REVIEW-015.

3. **Board cell encoding is specified, not delegated.** Flat `ReadonlyArray<CellType>` with `y * width + x` indexing is fixed here so that the shared engine codebase (per module 02's principles) is binary-compatible across SpacetimeDB, Convex, and the web clients. Downstream modules must not redefine this.

4. **Sub-seed derivation uses BLAKE3 keyed hashing specifically.** Any consumer of `subSeed()` must import the same BLAKE3 implementation; switching hash algorithms breaks replay reproducibility. This is a hard dependency, not a "pick your favourite hash" situation.

5. **Chess timer arithmetic is specified at the game-rules level** (Section 2.9). Module 04's reducer implementations must match the formulas exactly — in particular the "credit unspent clock back to budget on early declare" step, which is easy to miss.

6. **Turn event ordering is deterministic.** Replay viewers (08, 09) can assume events arrive in phase-then-snakeId order and need not re-sort.

7. **Phase 4 is a no-op mutation phase.** Downstream event consumers should not expect any state changes in Phase 4 beyond the disruption buffer accumulation that already happened in Phase 3. Event emission in Phase 11 can skip Phase 4 entirely.

8. **`GameState` aggregate shape is exported** (see resolved 01-REVIEW-013). The canonical shape is `{ board: Board, snakes: ReadonlyArray<SnakeState>, items: ReadonlyArray<ItemState>, clocks: ReadonlyArray<CentaurTeamClockState> }`. Module 04 must assemble this shape from its SpacetimeDB tables when calling `resolveTurn` and must destructure it from the result. Module 07 may continue to consume components individually through its simulation layer but should reference the exported `GameState` type for structural alignment.

9. **Effect-state immutability is a structural invariant, not a snapshot.** 01-REQ-033 is satisfied by the ordering discipline described in Section 2.7: no code path between start-of-turn and Phase 9 writes to `snake.activeEffects`. Because `invulnerabilityLevel(snake)` and `isVisible(snake)` are pure functions over `activeEffects`, they inherit the invariant automatically. Any future phase that needs to mutate effect state mid-turn must either (a) be placed at or after Phase 9, or (b) reintroduce an explicit snapshot taken at the start of Phase 1 and reroute pre-mutation reads through it. Downstream modules that implement `resolveTurn` must preserve this invariant verbatim; violating it silently breaks disruption cancellation semantics.
